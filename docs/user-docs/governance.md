# Governance

:::warning
**Firm Finance currently has no governance token available. Please be cautious of scams.** 
:::

Governance do NOT have the power to:
- Mint new FIRM or control user Troves.
- Upgrade the protocol contracts.
- Change the split or behavior of protocol interest payment fees.

Governance does have the power to:
- Add and remove collateral types with a timelock.
- Update the over-collateralization requirements with a timelock.
- Turn governance power over to a new system with a timelock.

:::tip
Timelock means that these changes must be submitted transparently onchain, but do not come into effect until a certain amount of time has passed. The default timelock period is 7 days.
