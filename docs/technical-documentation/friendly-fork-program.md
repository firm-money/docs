# Liquity Friendly Fork Program

While extending Liquity's base protocol, we did not do it in the dark or in secret. Firm was built in the open for everyone to see and with permission from the Liquity team. We are a "Friendly Fork" and chose to pay a small license fee to them and have been granted the exclusive right to use Liquity's code on Saga EVM. In return Firm received enormous help directly from the Liquity team: 

- They gave us lots of technical support from incredible engineers like Colin Platt.
- They shared their audit reports with us early which allowed us to improve the security of our protocol faster.
- They helped us connect and partner with LP networks like the Defi Collective.

When Liquity wins, Firm wins. When Firm wins, Liquity wins.
